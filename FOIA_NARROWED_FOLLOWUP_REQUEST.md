**RE:** Narrowed FOIA Request - Contest Grounds and Evidence Type Data

---

## I. INTRODUCTION

Thank you for your response dated [date] providing administrative hearing outcome records for 1.2 million contested tickets. This data has been invaluable for public transparency and helping Chicago residents understand their rights.

I am submitting this **narrowed and clarified** FOIA request to address your concerns about burden while still obtaining information critical to the public interest.

## II. CLARIFICATION OF ORIGINAL REQUEST

In your response, you stated that providing contest grounds and evidence types would be "overly burdensome" because it would require:
- Listening to audio recordings and transcribing statements
- Printing and redacting documentation for each ticket

**I want to clarify: I am NOT requesting audio transcription or document production.**

I am requesting only **structured data** that already exists in your case management system - specifically, the categories and fields that hearing officers and intake staff use when processing contests.

## III. NARROWED REQUEST - STRUCTURED DATA ONLY

Pursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act (5 ILCS 140), I request the following records:

### A. Contest Ground Categories (Structured Fields Only)

For each contested ticket record in your system (matching the 1.2M records previously provided), please provide:

1. **Contest ground category/type** - if your system uses structured fields, checkboxes, dropdown menus, or predefined categories to capture the basis for the contest
2. **Defense claim codes** - any standardized codes or categories used internally to classify defense arguments

**Format:** Database export of existing fields (no manual transcription needed)

**Example fields that may exist in your system:**
- "Not the owner/lessee of vehicle"
- "Vehicle was stolen"
- "Signs were missing/obscured"
- "Meter was broken"
- "Emergency situation"
- "Other" (with freeform field)

**Clarification:**
- I am NOT requesting full written arguments or hearing transcripts
- I am ONLY requesting the structured category/type if it exists as a database field
- If no structured field exists, please state "Contest grounds are not captured in structured format"

### B. Evidence Type Categories (Structured Fields Only)

For each contested ticket record in your system, please provide:

1. **Evidence type submitted** - the category/type of evidence filed with the contest
2. **Number of evidence items** - count of items submitted (if tracked)

**Format:** Database export of existing categorization fields (no content review needed)

**Example categories that may exist in your system:**
- Photograph/image
- Video recording
- Written document/letter
- Witness statement/affidavit
- Permit/registration
- Receipt
- Other documentation
- No evidence submitted

**Clarification:**
- I am NOT requesting the actual evidence files or descriptions of their contents
- I am ONLY requesting the type/category if it exists as a database field
- If hearing officers log evidence types during intake or hearings, this is what I'm requesting
- If no structured field exists, please state "Evidence types are not captured in structured format"

### C. Alternative: Recent Sample (If Full Dataset is Burdensome)

If providing the full dataset remains burdensome even for structured fields only, I will accept:

**Option 1:** Most recent 12 months of data (approximately 200,000 records)

**Option 2:** Random sample of 10,000 records across all years

**Option 3:** Top 10 most-contested violation types only (approximately 700,000 records based on prior data)

### D. Alternative: Aggregated Statistics (If Case-Level Data is Unavailable)

If individual case records cannot be provided, please provide aggregated statistics:

1. **Count of contests by contest ground type/category**
   - Example: "Not owner/lessee: 45,000 cases; Signs obscured: 32,000 cases; etc."

2. **Count of contests by evidence type submitted**
   - Example: "Photographs: 250,000 cases; Written documents: 180,000 cases; etc."

3. **Win rates correlated with contest grounds**
   - Example: "Not owner/lessee win rate: 78%; Signs obscured win rate: 62%; etc."

4. **Win rates correlated with evidence type**
   - Example: "Contests with photographs: 58% win rate; No evidence: 42% win rate; etc."

## IV. CLARIFYING QUESTIONS TO ASSIST WITH REQUEST

To help narrow this request appropriately, please answer these questions:

1. **Case Management System:**
   - What case management software does DOAH use for vehicle division hearings?
   - Does this system have structured fields for contest grounds or defense types?
   - Does this system have structured fields for evidence type or document categories?

2. **Data Availability:**
   - When respondents file a contest, do they indicate their reason via form fields or checkboxes?
   - When evidence is submitted, is the type of evidence logged in your system?
   - Do hearing officers record contest basis or evidence type in structured fields?

3. **Burden Assessment:**
   - If contest grounds and evidence types exist as structured database fields, what specific burden would prevent their disclosure?
   - Have you previously produced similar data in response to other FOIA requests?

## V. PUBLIC INTEREST STATEMENT

This narrowed request serves substantial public interest:

### Access to Justice
- Helps Chicago residents make informed decisions about contesting tickets
- Shows which defenses and evidence types are most effective
- Reduces information asymmetry between the city and residents

### Government Transparency
- Ensures accountability in a system collecting millions in annual fines
- Allows public oversight of administrative hearing fairness
- Reveals whether certain defenses are systematically rejected regardless of merit

### Supporting Vulnerable Communities
- Low-income residents disproportionately affected by parking fines
- This data empowers them to effectively contest unjust tickets
- Community organizations need this information to provide effective assistance

### Research and Advocacy
- Legal aid organizations need data to advise clients
- Researchers studying administrative justice require this information
- Policy advocates use this to identify systemic reforms needed

## VI. NO EXEMPTIONS APPLY

This request does not fall under FOIA exemptions:

- **Not private information (7(1)(b)):** Contest grounds and evidence types are part of public hearing records
- **Not unduly burdensome (3(g)):** Structured database fields can be exported with minimal effort
- **Not proprietary (7(1)(g)):** This is government data about public administrative proceedings

## VII. FORMAT AND DELIVERY

**Preferred format:** CSV, Excel, or database dump

**Delivery method:** Email to [your email] or secure file transfer

**Fee:** I will pay reasonable copying fees. Please provide a fee estimate if costs exceed $50.

## VIII. TIMELINE

Per 5 ILCS 140/3(d), please respond within 5 business days with either:
1. The requested records
2. A written denial with specific legal basis
3. A notice that additional time is needed (with explanation)

## IX. WILLINGNESS TO COLLABORATE

I remain willing to:
- Further narrow the scope if needed
- Accept a sample dataset if the full set is truly burdensome
- Meet with DOAH staff to discuss a mutually acceptable approach
- Accept aggregated statistics if case-level data is unavailable

My goal is transparency and public access, not to create unreasonable burden on DOAH.

## X. CONCLUSION

This narrowed request focuses exclusively on structured data that should already exist in your case management system. If such data exists, producing it should require only a database query and export - not manual review, transcription, or redaction of individual cases.

If DOAH maintains that even this narrowed request is burdensome, please provide:
1. Specific explanation of what makes exporting structured database fields burdensome
2. Clarification of whether contest grounds and evidence types exist as structured fields
3. Alternative proposal for providing this information in a less burdensome format

Thank you for your consideration and commitment to transparency.

## APPENDIX A: Example Use Cases

**Example 1 - Helping Residents Make Informed Decisions:**
A Chicago resident gets a street cleaning ticket. Using FOIA data, they see:
- "Signs obscured" defense has 67% win rate for this violation
- Submitting photographs increases win rate by 23%
- Contesting by mail has similar success to in-person for this violation
→ They know to take photos and contest by mail, saving time and money

**Example 2 - Identifying Systemic Issues:**
Analysis reveals:
- "Vehicle stolen" defense has 89% win rate when supporting documentation is provided
- But only 12% win rate without documentation
- Many low-income residents don't have access to police reports
→ Policy advocates can push for reforms to help legitimate victims

**Example 3 - Legal Aid Organizations:**
Community legal clinics use data to:
- Advise clients on strongest defenses for their situations
- Know what evidence to gather before hearings
- Identify patterns of unfair denials to challenge systematically

---

## APPENDIX B: Comparison to Data Already Provided

DOAH successfully provided structured data including:
- Violation codes (structured field)
- Hearing officer names (structured field)
- Contest type: Mail/In-Person/Virtual (structured field)
- Disposition: Liable/Not Liable/Denied (structured field)
- Reason for decision (structured field with standardized reasons)

**The data I'm now requesting should exist in similar structured format:**
- Contest ground type (parallel to "Contest type")
- Evidence type (parallel to "Violation code")

If DOAH can export "Reason for decision" with values like "Prima Facie Case Not Established" and "Violation is Factually Inconsistent," they should be able to export contest grounds with similar categorical values.
