# How to Get Your Resend API Key

Since you're on the Resend dashboard showing "Onboarding" API key:

## Step 1: Click on the API key name
Click on "Onboarding" in the table

## Step 2: Look for the token/key
You should see something like:
- A "Token" or "API Key" field
- Or a "Copy" button next to the masked key

## Step 3: Copy the key
The key should start with `re_`

## Alternative: Create a new API key
If you can't see/copy the existing key:
1. Look for a "Create API Key" or "+ New API Key" button
2. Name it something like "Production"
3. Select "Full access" permission
4. Copy the key (it will only be shown once!)

---

The key format should look like: `re_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
