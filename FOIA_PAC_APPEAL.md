**RE:** Appeal of Partial Denial - FOIA Request to Chicago Department of Administrative Hearings

---

## I. INTRODUCTION

I am writing to appeal the partial denial of my Freedom of Information Act request to the Chicago Department of Administrative Hearings (DOAH), received on [date of response]. While DOAH provided valuable data on administrative hearing outcomes, they denied three critical categories of information that are essential to the public interest and not unduly burdensome to produce.

## II. DENIED INFORMATION

DOAH denied the following requested information, claiming it would be "overly burdensome":

1. **Contest grounds raised by respondent** (written arguments/claims)
2. **Evidence type submitted** (categorized as: photographs, witness statements, documentation, video, dashcam footage, expert testimony, other)
3. **Evidence description** (if available)

## III. GROUNDS FOR APPEAL

### A. The Denial Does Not Meet the Legal Standard for "Unduly Burdensome"

Section 3(g) of FOIA requires that:
- The request would be "unduly burdensome"
- There is no way to narrow the request
- The burden on the public body outweighs the public interest

**DOAH has failed to establish any of these three required elements.**

### B. DOAH's Stated Burden is Based on Incorrect Assumptions

DOAH claims that compliance would require them to:
- "go through each individual ticket"
- "listen to any audio for that ticket and transcribe the statements"
- "print off and redact where necessary any documentation submitted"

**This characterization is incorrect for multiple reasons:**

#### 1. Contest Grounds Are Likely Already Categorized

Administrative hearing systems typically capture contest grounds through:
- Structured intake forms with predefined categories/checkboxes
- Case management system fields that hearing officers select from dropdown menus
- Standardized defense categories coded in the system

**If DOAH uses any structured data entry for contest grounds, producing this data would require only a database query, not manual review of each case.**

I request that DOAH clarify:
- Does their case management system capture contest grounds in structured fields?
- If so, what categories/options are available?
- If not, how do they track and report on common defense arguments for internal purposes?

#### 2. Evidence Type is Likely Already Categorized

Modern case management systems routinely categorize evidence submissions at intake. When respondents submit evidence:
- They typically indicate the type of evidence via form fields
- Hearing officers often log evidence types in case records
- Document management systems automatically categorize uploads by file type

**Producing a simple categorization (photo, video, document, witness statement, etc.) should not require reviewing the content of each submission.**

#### 3. We Can Narrow the Request Significantly

DOAH claimed "there is no way to narrow the request," yet we can narrow it in multiple ways:

**Option 1 - Recent Sample:**
- Limit to cases from the most recent 12 months (approximately 200,000 cases instead of 1.2M)
- Or limit to a random sample of 10,000 cases

**Option 2 - Structured Data Only:**
- Provide only contest grounds and evidence types that exist as structured data fields
- Exclude any that would require manual review or transcription

**Option 3 - High-Volume Violations Only:**
- Limit to the top 10 most-contested violation types (covering ~60% of all contests based on the data provided)

**Option 4 - Evidence Type Categories Only:**
- Provide just the evidence type categorization, without descriptions
- This is the minimum needed to assess what evidence is most effective

### C. Massive Public Interest Outweighs Any Burden

The public interest in this information is substantial and undeniable:

#### 1. Helps Chicago Residents Exercise Their Rights

- Over **1 million parking tickets are issued in Chicago annually**
- Most residents don't contest because they don't know which defenses work
- This data would help residents make informed decisions about whether to contest
- It directly affects residents' ability to defend against unjust fines

#### 2. Promotes Transparency in Administrative Hearings

- Shows whether certain defenses are systematically dismissed
- Reveals whether evidence submission actually affects outcomes
- Allows public oversight of hearing officer decision patterns
- Ensures accountability in a system that collects millions in fines annually

#### 3. Identifies Potential Systemic Issues

- If certain defenses are rarely successful, it may indicate procedural barriers
- If evidence type doesn't correlate with outcomes, hearings may not be fairly considering submissions
- This data could reveal discriminatory patterns or due process violations

#### 4. Supports Access to Justice Initiatives

- Non-profit legal aid organizations need this data to advise clients
- Law school clinics use this information for teaching and advocacy
- Researchers studying administrative justice rely on this data
- Community organizations helping low-income residents contest unfair tickets

#### 5. Economic Impact on Chicago Families

- Parking fines can range from $50-$200+
- For low-income families, one ticket can mean choosing between food and paying a fine
- If data shows high win rates for certain defenses, it empowers residents to fight back
- Reduces the regressive burden of parking fines on vulnerable communities

### D. DOAH's Response Suggests They Can Produce This Data

Notably, DOAH **successfully produced** extensive data on 1.2 million contested tickets, including:
- Ticket numbers, violation codes, dates, locations
- Hearing officer names, hearing types, hearing locations
- Dispositions and reasons for decisions

**The fact that DOAH could produce disposition reasons (e.g., "Violation is Factually Inconsistent," "Prima Facie Case Not Established") proves they maintain structured data on decision rationales.**

If they can export structured disposition reasons, they almost certainly can export structured contest grounds and evidence types.

### E. Precedent Supports Disclosure

Illinois courts have consistently held that:
- Public bodies must make reasonable efforts to comply with FOIA requests
- "Burdensome" does not mean "takes time" - it means truly excessive burden
- Public interest in oversight of government fines and enforcement is high
- Duncan Publishing, Inc. v. City of Chicago, 304 Ill. App. 3d 778 (1999)

In *Harwood v. McDonough*, the Illinois Supreme Court stated that inconvenience alone does not establish undue burden.

## IV. PROPOSED RESOLUTION

To resolve this appeal efficiently, I propose the following:

### Option 1 (Preferred): Provide Structured Data
If contest grounds and evidence types exist as structured fields in DOAH's case management system, provide:
- All records with contest ground categories (as coded in their system)
- All records with evidence type categories (as coded in their system)
- No manual transcription or review required - just database exports

### Option 2: Recent Sample
Provide contest grounds and evidence types for:
- The most recent 12 months of contested tickets, OR
- A random sample of 10,000 cases across all years

### Option 3: Aggregated Statistics
If providing individual case data is truly burdensome, provide aggregated statistics:
- Count of contests by contest ground type
- Count of contests by evidence type submitted
- Win rates correlated with contest grounds and evidence types
- Breakdown by violation code

### Option 4: Meet and Confer
I am willing to meet with DOAH representatives to discuss a mutually acceptable scope that balances the public interest with DOAH's operational constraints.

## V. CONCLUSION

DOAH has not met its burden under Section 3(g) to demonstrate that:
1. Producing this data is unduly burdensome
2. There is no way to narrow the request
3. The burden outweighs the substantial public interest

The denied information is essential for:
- Helping Chicago residents exercise their legal rights
- Ensuring transparency and accountability in administrative hearings
- Identifying systemic issues in the hearing process
- Supporting access to justice for low-income residents

I respectfully request that the Public Access Counselor:
1. **Issue a binding opinion requiring DOAH to produce the denied records**, or
2. **Require DOAH to clarify whether contest grounds and evidence types exist as structured data**, and if so, require production
3. **Require DOAH to work with me to narrow the request** to an acceptable scope rather than denying it outright

## VI. SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION

Attached:
1. Original FOIA request
2. DOAH's partial denial response
3. Sample of data already provided by DOAH
4. Examples showing the public interest in this information
