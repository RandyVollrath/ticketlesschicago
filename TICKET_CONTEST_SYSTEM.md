# Ticket Contest System - Technical Documentation

## Overview
Automated ticket contesting platform with AI-powered OCR, contest letter generation, and win probability calculator.

## Features Built

### 1. Core Ticket Contest Flow
**Pages:**
- `/contest-ticket` - Main contest page with 4-step wizard
- `/my-contests` - Contest history and management

**Components:**
- `TicketContester.tsx` - Main contest workflow component
- Integrated into Settings page with "Contest Now" and "View History" buttons

**Flow:**
1. Upload ticket photo (JPG/PNG)
2. AI extracts details via Claude Vision
3. Select contest grounds
4. See real-time win probability
5. Generate professional contest letter + evidence checklist

### 2. AI-Powered OCR & Analysis
**API:** `/api/contest/upload-ticket`
- Uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet Vision API
- Extracts: ticket #, violation code, description, date, amount, location, plate
- Stores photo in Supabase storage
- Creates initial contest record

### 3. Contest Letter Generation
**API:** `/api/contest/generate-letter`
- Uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet for letter writing
- Cites Chicago ordinances
- Personalizes with user data
- Generates evidence checklist based on grounds
- Fallback template if API unavailable

### 4. Win Probability Calculator
**API:** `/api/contest/win-probability`

**Calculation Factors:**
- Base probability from historical data (by violation type)
- Evidence quality: +10% photos, +8% witnesses, +7% documentation
- Number of grounds: +5% if 3+, -15% if 0
- Time factor: +3% if ≤7 days, -5% if >60 days
- Strong legal grounds: +12%

**Output:**
- Probability percentage (5-95%)
- Color-coded recommendation (green/amber/red)
- Suggestions to improve chances
- Detailed breakdown

**Real-time Updates:**
- Recalculates as user selects/deselects grounds

## Technical Notes

### Claude Vision API
- Model: `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`
- Max tokens: 1024 for extraction
- Max tokens: 2048 for letter generation
- Accepts: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- Max image size: 10MB

### Win Probability Algorithm
```
probability = baseProbability
  + (hasPhotos ? 10 : 0)
  + (hasWitnesses ? 8 : 0)
  + (hasDocumentation ? 7 : 0)
  + (numGrounds >= 3 ? 5 : 0)
  + (numGrounds === 0 ? -15 : 0)
  + (hasStrongGround ? 12 : 0)
  + (daysSinceTicket <= 7 ? 3 : daysSinceTicket > 60 ? -5 : 0)
```

Capped at 5-95%

### Performance
- Image upload: ~2-5s
- OCR extraction: ~3-8s (Claude API)
- Letter generation: ~5-10s (Claude API)
- Win probability: <100ms (local calculation)

### Security
- All APIs require authentication
- RLS policies enforce user isolation
- File uploads sanitized
- SQL injection protected (parameterized queries)
- CORS configured for same-origin only

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Upload ticket photo → extracts correctly
- [ ] Select grounds → probability updates
- [ ] Generate letter → creates formatted letter
- [ ] Copy letter → clipboard works
- [ ] View history → shows all contests
- [ ] Click contest → opens modal with details
- [ ] Mobile responsive → all pages work
- [ ] Build succeeds → no TypeScript errors

## Production Deployment
1. Add real ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to Vercel env vars
2. Run database migration in production Supabase
3. Test image upload to production storage
4. Verify RLS policies work
5. Monitor Claude API usage/costs
6. Set up error tracking (Sentry recommended)

## Cost Estimates

### Claude API Costs
- Vision (ticket extraction): ~$0.015 per ticket
- Text generation (letter): ~$0.01 per letter
- **Total: ~$0.025 per complete contest**

For 1000 contests/month: ~$25/month in AI costs

### Storage Costs
- Supabase storage: ~$0.021/GB
- Average ticket photo: 2MB
- 1000 tickets = 2GB = ~$0.04/month

### Total Infrastructure
~$25-30/month for 1000 contests

## Support
For issues:
- Check Claude API key is set correctly
- Verify database migration ran successfully
- Check Supabase storage bucket permissions
- Review browser console for errors
