# üöÄ Ticketless Chicago Mobile App - Quick Start

## TL;DR - Get Running in 10 Minutes

Everything is built. Here's how to test it:

---

## Step 1: Database (2 minutes)

Go to Supabase SQL Editor and run these 2 files:

1. `database/create-enhanced-spatial-functions.sql`
2. `database/create-snow-route-status-table.sql`

---

## Step 2: Test Backend API (1 minute)

```bash
cd /home/randy-vollrath/ticketless-chicago
npm run dev
```

In another terminal:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/check-parking-location-enhanced \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"latitude": 41.8781, "longitude": -87.6298}'
```

You should see JSON with parking restrictions!

## Step 3: Run Mobile App on Android (5 minutes)
