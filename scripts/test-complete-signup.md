## 🔧 **WHAT WAS FIXED**

The webhook was only saving partial form data. I fixed it to save ALL form fields:

### **Now Saves:**
- ✅ **Name** → Split into first_name/last_name fields
- ✅ **Phone** → phone field
- ✅ **Renewal Dates** → city_sticker_expiry, license_plate_expiry, emissions_date
- ✅ **Addresses** → street_address (for cleaning alerts), mailing_address/city/state/zip
- ✅ **Vehicle Info** → license_plate, vin, vehicle_type, vehicle_year, zip_code
- ✅ **Notification Preferences** → All settings including reminder_days array
- ✅ **Concierge Options** → concierge_service, city_stickers_only, spending_limit

## 🧪 **HOW TO TEST**

1. **Fill Complete Form** on homepage with:
   - Full name (e.g., "John Smith")
