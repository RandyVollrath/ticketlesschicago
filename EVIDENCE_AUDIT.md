## PROBLEMATIC EVIDENCE ITEMS IDENTIFIED

### CRITICAL ISSUES (Items asking users to do impossible things or that are fundamentally problematic):

**NONE FOUND** - All evidence items ask users to provide or obtain reasonable documentation that users either:
1. Already have or can easily collect (photos, receipts, documentation)
2. Can request from authorities (311 reports, police reports, permits, weather data)
3. Have access to via their own actions (app screenshots, GPS history, witness statements, medical records)

### POTENTIAL CONCERNS (Items worth reviewing):

1. **Medical Emergency Evidence** (Handicapped Zone, Double Parking)
   - Status: OK - Users who experienced a medical emergency can provide hospital records or doctor's notes
   - Not asking them to CREATE one, just PROVIDE evidence if one occurred

2. **Vehicle Stolen/Sold Evidence** (City Sticker, Red Light, Speed Camera, Handicapped Zone)
   - Status: OK - Users can file police reports (stolen) or provide bills of sale (sold)
   - These are reasonable requests for situations users may have experienced

3. **Vehicle Disabled Evidence** (Bike Lane, Bus Lane, Bus Stop, Double Parking, Parking Alley)
   - Status: OK - Users can provide tow truck receipts, mechanic statements, roadside assistance records
   - This documents something that actually happened to them

4. **Emergency Documentation** (Double Parking, Handicapped Zone, Parking Alley, Street Cleaning)
   - Status: OK - Users provide documentation of emergencies they experienced
   - Not asking them to CREATE an emergency, just PROVIDE evidence if one occurred

5. **Police Report for Stolen Placard/Sticker** (City Sticker, Handicapped Zone)
   - Status: OK - Users should file a report if their placard was stolen
   - Asks them to take appropriate action, not something impossible

6. **GPS Departure Proof** (Snow Route, Street Cleaning, Residential Permit)
   - Status: OK - This is automatic data from the app that users already use
   - Users just need to have the app to be able to provide this

7. **Weather Records** (Snow Route, Street Cleaning, Fire Hydrant, Expired Meter)
   - Status: OK - Historical weather data is public and freely available
   - Asking users to research/provide publicly available information

### CONFUSING OR POTENTIALLY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE ITEMS:

1. **"Witness Statement" for Meter Malfunction** (Expired Meter)
   - Impact: 0.15 (very low)
   - Issue: Getting a stranger to write a statement about seeing a broken meter is unlikely/awkward
   - Suggestion: This is essentially useless as evidence; consider removing or marking as extremely low priority

2. **"Witness Statement" for Street Cleaning** (Street Cleaning)
   - Impact: 0.10 (extremely low)
   - Issue: Neighbor confirmation doesn't carry much evidentiary weight
   - Suggestion: Consider removing or deprioritizing

3. **"No Cleaning Evidence" from Street Cleaning** (Street Cleaning)
   - Description: "Photos showing the street wasn't cleaned or sweeper didn't come"
   - Issue: Photos taken AFTER the supposed cleaning time but showing "debris still on street" is extremely weak evidence (street gets dirty again quickly)
   - Suggestion: Rework to be more focused on specific evidence (FOIA sweeper GPS data, 311 complaints)

4. **"Passenger Witness" for Bus Lane** (Bus Lane)
   - Impact: 0.20
   - Issue: Getting a passenger to write a formal statement after the fact is low probability
   - Context: Dashcam footage is much more valuable
   - Suggestion: This works better as "rideshare app records proving passenger pickup/dropoff"

## SUMMARY

**Total Evidence Items Reviewed:** ~90 unique evidence items across 18 contest kits

**Problematic Items Found:** 0 (NONE - all items are reasonable requests)

**Items Worth Reconsidering:** 4 (witness statements, street cleaning debris photos)

**Assessment:** The contest kits are overall well-designed. Evidence items consistently ask users to:
- Photograph situations they can observe
- Provide documentation they may already have
- Request public records (weather, police reports, city records)
- Use their own app data (GPS, parking history)

Users are never asked to:
- Create false evidence
- Perform impossible acts
- Do something that contradicts reality
- Report non-existent situations as fact
