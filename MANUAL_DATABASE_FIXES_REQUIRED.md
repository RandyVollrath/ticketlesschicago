## ‚ö†Ô∏è Required Manual Fixes (Database)

### 1. Fix Drip Campaign Foreign Key Relationship

**Problem:** Welcome emails not sending because drip_campaign_status table can't join with user_profiles table.

**Error:** "Could not find a relationship between 'drip_campaign_status' and 'user_profiles' in the schema cache"

**Solution:**
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT/sql
2. Run this SQL:

```sql
-- Drop constraint if it exists (idempotent)
DO $$
BEGIN
    IF EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.table_constraints
        WHERE constraint_name = 'drip_campaign_status_user_id_fkey'
        AND table_name = 'drip_campaign_status'
    ) THEN
        ALTER TABLE drip_campaign_status DROP CONSTRAINT drip_campaign_status_user_id_fkey;
    END IF;
END $$;

-- Add foreign key relationship
ALTER TABLE drip_campaign_status
ADD CONSTRAINT drip_campaign_status_user_id_fkey
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES user_profiles(user_id)
ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Create index for faster joins
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS drip_campaign_status_user_id_idx
ON drip_campaign_status(user_id);
```

3. After running the SQL, trigger the drip campaign manually:

```bash
curl -L "https://www.autopilotamerica.com/api/drip/send-emails" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer 4c172831a589e4306eb3edb56d5351e40afb6761f3d57b5e04c068920e3ed372"
```

This will send welcome emails to your 2 test users.

### 2. Create Ticket Contests Table

**Problem:** Ticket contest uploads failing with error: "Could not find the table 'public.ticket_contests' in the schema cache"

**Solution:**
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT/sql
2. Run the SQL from: `database/migrations/create_ticket_contests.sql`

The file contains all the necessary table creation, indexes, triggers, and RLS policies.
