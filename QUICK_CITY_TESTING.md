## What "Match" Means

You DON'T need:
- ‚ùå Exact times to match
- ‚ùå Perfect street segment boundaries
- ‚ùå 100% accuracy

You DO need:
- ‚úÖ Same street name found
- ‚úÖ Same general day of week (if it says "Monday" and official says "1st Monday", that's fine)
- ‚úÖ Roughly correct area

**Example of GOOD ENOUGH:**
- Official: "1st & 3rd Monday, 8am-11am, Mission St between 14th-16th"
- Your tool: "Mondays, 8am-12pm, Mission St"
- **PASS** ‚úÖ Close enough for beta!

**Example of NOT GOOD:**
- Official: "Tuesdays, 9am-12pm"
- Your tool: "No street sweeping found"
- **FAIL** ‚ùå Data is broken

## After Testing

### If 4-5 cities pass:
1. Add `<BetaBanner city="San Francisco" />` to each page
2. Ship it
3. Wait for user feedback
4. Enable notifications after 1-2 weeks if no major errors

### If cities fail:
1. Check database - is data actually imported?
2. Check API - is geocoding working?
3. Debug or skip that city

## Total Time Investment
- **30 minutes** (10 mins √ó 3 cities)
- vs. **Days/weeks** of comprehensive testing

## Risk Mitigation
- Beta label sets expectations
- "Report error" link captures issues
- Can disable city anytime if problems arise
- Users verify schedules with signs anyway

**Ship fast, iterate based on real feedback** üöÄ
