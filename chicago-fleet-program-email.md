Dear Chicago Finance Department,

I am writing to inquire about enrolling in the City's **Corporate Fleet Program** for parking ticket notifications.

## About Our Service

Ticketless Chicago (https://www.autopilotamerica.com) is a parking ticket prevention service that helps Chicago residents and visitors avoid parking violations through real-time, location-based alerts. Our service notifies users about:

- Street cleaning schedules
- Snow emergency zones
- Permit-only parking restrictions
- Temporary parking bans (events, construction, etc.)

We currently serve [NUMBER] users in the Chicago area who have opted into our monitoring service.

## Why We're Requesting Fleet Program Access

To better serve our users, we would like to **proactively monitor their vehicles for parking tickets** so we can:

1. **Alert users immediately** when a ticket is issued
2. **Provide proof-of-notification** for dispute cases (timestamped alerts showing we warned them before the violation)
3. **Help users pay tickets promptly**, reducing collection costs for the City
4. **Identify patterns** to improve our prevention algorithms

Our users have explicitly authorized us to monitor their vehicles by providing their license plate numbers, states, and last names.

## Program Details

According to the City's website, the Corporate Fleet Program allows companies to:
- Provide a list of license plate numbers
- Receive monthly email notifications of tickets issued to those plates

**We are requesting:**
- Enrollment in this program on behalf of our users
- Monthly (or more frequent, if available) email notifications of tickets
- Ability to update our plate list as new users join

**We will provide:**
- Complete list of license plates and registration states
- User consent documentation if required
- Verification of our business and service

## How This Benefits Chicago

1. **Faster payments**: Users will be notified immediately and can pay promptly
2. **Fewer disputes**: Our prevention alerts create a clear record that users were warned
3. **Better compliance**: Users avoiding tickets means cleaner streets and safer neighborhoods
4. **Reduced administrative burden**: Fewer contested tickets and collections cases

## Technical Capabilities

We have robust systems in place to:
- Securely store and manage license plate data (encrypted database)
- Parse email notifications automatically
- Alert users via push notifications, email, and SMS
- Track notification history for dispute resolution

## Next Steps

Could we schedule a call or meeting to discuss:
1. Eligibility requirements for the Corporate Fleet Program
2. The enrollment process and required documentation
3. Technical specifications for the notification emails
4. Update procedures as our user base grows

I'm available at your convenience and happy to provide any additional information needed.

Thank you for your time and consideration. We look forward to partnering with the City of Chicago to help reduce parking violations and improve compliance.

Best regards,

**Randy Vollrath**
