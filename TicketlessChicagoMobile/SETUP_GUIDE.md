# Ticketless Chicago Mobile App - Complete Setup Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start (For Complete Beginners)

This guide assumes you've NEVER built a mobile app before. We'll go step-by-step.

---

## Prerequisites

### 1. Install Node.js 20+

**Check if you have Node:**
```bash
node --version
```

If it says "node: command not found" or shows a version less than 20, install Node:

**Mac:**
```bash
# Install Homebrew first if you don't have it
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Then install Node
brew install node@20
```

**Linux:**
```bash
# Use nvm (Node Version Manager)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
nvm install 20
nvm use 20
```

---

## Part 1: Backend Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Run the SQL Migration

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com
2. Click on your project
3. Go to "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
4. Click "New Query"
5. Copy the contents of `/database/create-mobile-api-functions.sql`
6. Paste it into the SQL editor
7. Click "Run" (or press Cmd+Enter / Ctrl+Enter)

‚úÖ You should see: "Success. No rows returned"

### Step 2: Test the API Endpoint

```bash
# From your ticketless-chicago directory (NOT the mobile app folder)
cd /home/randy-vollrath/ticketless-chicago

# Start your Next.js server
npm run dev
```

Open a new terminal and test:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/check-parking-location \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"latitude": 41.8781, "longitude": -87.6298}'
```

‚úÖ You should see JSON response with parking rules

## Part 3: Running the App

### Terminal Window 1: Start Metro Bundler

```bash
cd /home/randy-vollrath/ticketless-chicago/TicketlessChicagoMobile
npm start
```

Keep this running. You should see:
```
Welcome to Metro!
  Fast - Scalable - Integrated
```

### Terminal Window 2: Run the App

**For iOS:**
```bash
cd /home/randy-vollrath/ticketless-chicago/TicketlessChicagoMobile
npx react-native run-ios
```

This will:
1. Open the iOS Simulator automatically
2. Build the app (takes 2-5 minutes first time)
3. Install and launch the app

**For Android:**
1. First, start your emulator in Android Studio (click the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è play button next to your device)
2. Wait for it to fully boot (shows home screen)
3. Then run:

```bash
cd /home/randy-vollrath/ticketless-chicago/TicketlessChicagoMobile
npx react-native run-android
```

‚úÖ The app should launch on your emulator/simulator!

---

## Part 4: Testing the App

### Test 1: Check Current Location (No Car Needed)

1. In the app, tap "üîç Check Current Location"
2. Grant location permissions when prompted
3. Wait a few seconds
4. You should see:
   - Either parking restrictions found
   - Or "No restrictions found"

If you get an error:
- Make sure your Next.js server is running (Part 1, Step 2)
- Check the Metro bundler terminal for error messages

### Test 2: Pair a Fake Bluetooth Device (Simulator Testing)

**Note:** Bluetooth doesn't work well in simulators. To test:

Option A: Use a real device (see Part 5)
Option B: For now, skip Bluetooth testing

---

## Part 5: Running on a Real Device

### iOS (Real iPhone)

#### Step 1: Connect Your iPhone

1. Plug iPhone into your Mac with USB cable

1. Open Xcode
2. File ‚Üí Open ‚Üí Navigate to:
   ```
   /home/randy-vollrath/ticketless-chicago/TicketlessChicagoMobile/ios/TicketlessChicagoMobile.xcworkspace
   ```
3. Click on "TicketlessChicagoMobile" in left sidebar (blue icon)
4. Under "Signing & Capabilities":
   - Check "Automatically manage signing"
   - Select your Apple ID team
   - Change "Bundle Identifier" to something unique:
     `com.yourname.ticketlesschicago`

#### Step 3: Run on Device

```bash
npx react-native run-ios --device="Your iPhone Name"
```

Or in Xcode: Select your device from the dropdown and click ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

### Android (Real Phone)

#### Step 1: Enable Developer Mode

On your Android phone:
1. Settings ‚Üí About Phone

## Part 6: Testing Bluetooth Car Detection

### Step 1: Pair Your Car

1. Start your car (or turn on ignition)
2. On your phone, go to Settings ‚Üí Bluetooth
3. Connect to your car's Bluetooth
4. Go back to the Ticketless app
5. Tap "Pair Your Car"

### Step 3: Test the System

1. Start driving
2. Park somewhere (preferably on a street with street cleaning)
3. Turn off your car (this disconnects Bluetooth)
4. Within 10 seconds, you should get a notification about parking restrictions

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Command not found" Errors

**Metro bundler won't start:**
```bash
# Clear cache and restart
cd /home/randy-vollrath/ticketless-chicago/TicketlessChicagoMobile
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npm start -- --reset-cache
```

**iOS won't build:**
```bash
cd ios
pod deintegrate
pod install
cd ..
npx react-native run-ios
```

**Android won't build:**
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
npx react-native run-android
```

### App Crashes Immediately

Check the Metro bundler terminal for error messages:
- Red text = error
- Yellow text = warning (usually okay)

Common fixes:
```bash
# Kill all Metro processes
killall -9 node

# Clear watchman
watchman watch-del-all

# Clear all caches
rm -rf $TMPDIR/react-*
rm -rf $TMPDIR/metro-*

# Restart
npm start -- --reset-cache
```

### Permissions Not Working

**iOS:**
- After running app, go to iPhone Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Location Services ‚Üí Ticketless Chicago
- Select "Always" (not "While Using")
- Enable "Precise Location"

**Android:**
- Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Ticketless Chicago ‚Üí Permissions
- Location: "Allow all the time"
- Nearby devices: "Allow"
- Notifications: "Allow"

### API Not Connecting

1. Check your computer's IP address:
   ```bash
   ipconfig getifaddr en0  # Mac
   # or
   hostname -I  # Linux
   ```

2. Update the API URL in `/src/config/env.ts`:
   ```typescript
   export const API_URL = __DEV__
     ? 'http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:3000'  // Use your actual IP
     : 'https://ticketless.fyi';
   ```

3. Rebuild the app

### Bluetooth Not Detecting Car Disconnect

- Make sure you're testing on a REAL device (not simulator)
- Check that Bluetooth permissions are granted
- Your car's Bluetooth must be CONNECTED before you turn off the car
- Some cars take 30-60 seconds to fully disconnect

---

## Development Workflow

### Making Code Changes

1. Edit files in VS Code or your editor
2. Save the file
3. In the Metro bundler terminal, press `r` to reload
   - Or shake your device and tap "Reload"
   - Or press Cmd+R (iOS) / Double-tap R (Android)

### Viewing Logs

**iOS:**
```bash
npx react-native log-ios
```

**Android:**
```bash
npx react-native log-android
```

### Debugging

1. Shake device or press Cmd+D (iOS) / Cmd+M (Android)
2. Select "Debug"
3. Open Chrome and go to: `chrome://inspect`
4. Click "inspect" under your app
5. Use Chrome DevTools Console

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Test with Real Data

Drive around Chicago and test:
- Streets with street cleaning
- Snow routes (if winter)
- Permit zones

### 2. Improve the UI

- Add loading spinners
- Better error messages
- Add a map view

### 3. Deploy Backend to Production

Your API needs to be accessible from phones:
```bash
# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

Then update `/src/config/env.ts` with your production URL.

### 4. Submit to App Stores

**iOS:** You need an Apple Developer account ($99/year)
**Android:** Google Play Store account ($25 one-time)
