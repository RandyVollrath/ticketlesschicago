  ✓ Error boundaries and crash reporting setup

ARCHITECTURE:
  ✓ 9 well-designed services (single responsibility)
  ✓ Type-safe with TypeScript throughout
  ✓ Centralized configuration management
  ✓ Error categorization (8 types)
  ✓ Rate limiting and request deduplication
  ✓ Structured logging with breadcrumbs
  ✓ Proper state management with React hooks
  ✓ Component library (5 reusable components)

UI/UX:
  ✓ 8 screens (Home, Map, History, Profile, Settings, etc.)
  ✓ Bottom tab navigation
  ✓ Loading skeletons
  ✓ Pull-to-refresh
  ✓ Network status banner
  ✓ Error alerts and fallbacks

========================================
WHAT'S MISSING (Critical Blockers)
========================================

1. FIREBASE CONFIGURATION (REQUIRED)
   - Missing: GoogleService-Info.plist (iOS)
   - Missing: google-services.json (Android)
   - Impact: Push notifications won't work
   - Setup time: ~30-45 minutes
   - Files needed: Download from Firebase Console

2. APP ICONS & SPLASH SCREENS (REQUIRED)
   - Missing: icon.png (1024x1024)
   - Missing: splash.png (1242x2436)
   - Missing: adaptive-icon.png (Android)
   - Missing: iOS app icons in xcassets
   - Missing: Android mipmap resources
   - Impact: Cannot submit to app stores
   - Setup time: 2-4 hours (design) + generation

3. CODE SIGNING & CREDENTIALS (REQUIRED)
   - Missing: Apple Developer account setup
   - Missing: App identifiers and provisioning profiles
   - Missing: Android keystore file
   - Impact: Cannot build release versions
   - Setup time: 1-2 hours + account creation

========================================
WHAT'S MISSING (High Priority)
========================================

4. TESTING
   - No unit tests
   - No integration tests
   - No E2E tests
   - Recommendation: Add critical path tests

5. BIOMETRIC DEPENDENCY
   - Service implemented: BiometricService.ts
   - Missing: npm install react-native-biometrics
   - Setup time: <5 minutes

6. BUILD CONFIGURATION
   - Missing: Google Services plugin in Android gradle
   - Missing: Android release signing configuration
   - Missing: iOS release build setup in Xcode

7. APP STORE METADATA
   - Missing: Screenshots for multiple devices
   - Missing: App descriptions
   - Missing: Privacy policy
   - Missing: Terms of service
   - Missing: Support contact info

========================================
MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES (Low Priority)
========================================

8. DUPLICATE CONFIGURATION
   - config.ts and env.ts both define environment config
   - Recommendation: Consolidate into one file

9. SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS
   - Auth tokens stored in AsyncStorage (plaintext)
   - Recommendation: Use react-native-keychain instead

10. DOCUMENTATION
    - 2 minor TODOs in code (non-blocking)
    - Code comments minimal but method names clear
    - MOBILE_APP_README.md is excellent
