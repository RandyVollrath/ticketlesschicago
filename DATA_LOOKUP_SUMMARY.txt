STRONGEST EVIDENCE TYPES (BY IMPACT)
================================================================================

1. GPS DEPARTURE PROOF (45% weight)
   - Mobile app users: GPS proves they left before ticket issued
   - 50+ meters distance = conclusive departure
   - Time-stamped, digitally verifiable
   - Highest win rate impact

2. WEATHER DEFENSE (Variable, context-dependent)
   - Snow ≥0.5": Street cleaning cancelled
   - Freezing rain: Equipment can't operate
   - Cold <25°F: Equipment maintenance issues
   - Heavy rain ≥0.5": Sweeping ineffective
   - Auto-generated defense paragraphs included in letters

3. SIGNAGE ISSUES (Variable)
   - Faded/damaged/obscured/missing signs
   - Community-reported sign problems at location
   - Street View documentation
   - Obstruction documentation

4. PARKING HISTORY PATTERN (10% weight)
   - User regularly parks at location
   - Indicates familiarity with restrictions
   - 5+ visits = regular location
   - Supports claim of diligence

5. PERMIT ZONE EVIDENCE (Variable)
   - Outside restriction hours
   - Valid permit holder
   - Zone boundaries disputed
   - Time validation proof

6. HEARING OFFICER STRATEGY (Prediction value)
   - Tailor defense to officer's tendencies
   - Use evidence types officer accepts most
   - Match arguments to officer's strictness level
   - Predicts outcome probability

CUSTOMER VALUE: WHAT WE CHECK AUTOMATICALLY
================================================================================

When a parking ticket is detected, the system automatically:

1. Looks up Street View of the exact location to verify signage visibility
2. Retrieves historical weather data for the violation date
3. Verifies street cleaning/snow route/winter ban schedules
4. Checks user's mobile app parking history for departure proof
5. Analyzes hearing officer's track record (if known)
6. Calculates violation-specific win rates from FOIA data
7. Searches for community signage reports at the location
8. Verifies permit zone status and restriction hours
9. Confirms red light/speed camera locations
10. Generates weather defense paragraphs if applicable
11. Compiles comparable case outcomes
12. Identifies technical ordinance defenses
13. Ranks evidence by impact for this specific violation
14. Predicts case outcome probability
15. Generates personalized contest letter with strongest evidence

All data is compiled into ONE personalized contest letter, ready to submit.
