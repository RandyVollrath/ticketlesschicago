## 🚦 Red Light Camera Data

### 1. Camera Calibration and Maintenance Records
**Request to:** Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT)

**Request text:**
```
I am requesting records for all red light camera intersections in Chicago for the past 3 years:
1. Calibration certificates and test results for all cameras
2. Maintenance logs including repairs, replacements, and downtime
3. Failed calibration reports
4. Vendor service records
5. Camera serial numbers and installation dates

Format: Excel/CSV preferred with fields:
- Camera ID / Intersection location
- Date of calibration/maintenance
- Pass/Fail status
- Issues found
- Resolution
```

**Why this helps:**
- Identify cameras with calibration problems
- Build database of "problem intersections"
- When user gets ticket, instantly check if that camera had issues
- Strengthen contests with specific calibration failures

### 2. Yellow Light Timing Data
**Request to:** Chicago Department of Transportation

**Request text:**
```
I am requesting for all red light camera intersections:
1. Yellow light duration settings (in seconds)
2. Speed limit at each intersection
3. Date of last yellow light timing audit
4. Any changes to yellow light timing in past 5 years
5. Engineering studies justifying current timing

Federal standard: 3.0-4.0 seconds minimum

Format: Excel/CSV with:
- Intersection location
- Yellow light duration
- Speed limit
- Last audit date
```

**Why this helps:**
- Identify intersections with too-short yellow lights (automatic defense)
- Calculate if timing violates federal standards
- Show users which intersections are "traps"
- Build heatmap of problematic intersections

### 3. Red Light Camera Violation Statistics by Intersection
**Request to:** Chicago Department of Finance

**Request text:**
```
For each red light camera intersection, past 3 years:
1. Total violations issued per month
2. Revenue generated per intersection
3. Violation rates by time of day
4. Before/after statistics (when camera installed)
5. Any intersections removed or relocated

Format: Monthly data by intersection location
```

**Why this helps:**
- Identify "revenue traps" with suspiciously high ticket rates
- Spot timing manipulation (sudden spikes in violations)
- Show users if their intersection is statistically abnormal
- Context for letters: "This camera issues 3x more tickets than average"

## 🚗 Speed Camera Data

### 4. Speed Camera Calibration Records
**Request to:** Chicago Department of Transportation

**Request text:**
```
For all speed cameras in Chicago, past 3 years:
1. Calibration certificates and test results
2. Maintenance and repair logs
3. Failed calibrations or accuracy issues
4. Speed measurement error rates
5. Weather condition limitations
6. Camera serial numbers and locations

Format: Excel/CSV by camera location and date
```

**Why this helps:**
- Identify speed cameras with accuracy problems
- Show users if their specific camera had issues near their ticket date
- Provide evidence of systematic measurement errors

### 5. Speed Camera Signage Compliance Audits
**Request to:** Chicago Department of Transportation

**Request text:**
```
For all speed camera zones:
1. Signage placement audits (distance from camera)
2. Sign maintenance/replacement records
3. Complaints about missing or damaged signs
4. Photos of signage installations
5. Sign inventory by location

Chicago Municipal Code requires proper advance warning signage.

Format: Location-based records with photos if available
```

**Why this helps:**
- Identify locations with inadequate signage (strong defense)
- Provide baseline for users to compare their photos
- Systematic signage failures = dismissal

### 6. School and Park Zone Hours Documentation
**Request to:** Chicago Public Schools & Chicago Park District

**Request text:**
```
For all schools and parks with speed cameras:
1. Official school hours and calendar
2. Days school was closed (holidays, snow days, etc.)
3. Park operating hours
4. Correspondence about camera operating hours

Speed cameras only permitted 7am-7pm on school days.

Format: School/park name, address, calendar for past 3 years
```

**Why this helps:**
- Verify if tickets issued outside permitted hours (automatic dismissal)
- Cross-reference ticket time with school closures
- Provide instant defense for tickets during summer/holidays

## ⚖️ Administrative Hearing Data

### 7. Administrative Hearing Outcomes Database
**Request to:** Chicago Department of Administrative Hearings

**Request text:**
```
For all parking, moving, and camera violations, past 5 years:
1. Ticket number and violation code
2. Hearing date and outcome (dismissed/liable/reduced)
3. Contest grounds raised
4. Evidence submitted (photos, witnesses, documents)
5. Location of violation
6. Fine amount and reduction if applicable

This is public information under Illinois FOIA.

Format: Full database in CSV/Excel with:
- ticket_number
- violation_code
- violation_description
- location
- ticket_date
- hearing_date
- outcome
- contest_grounds (text)
- evidence_types (photos/witnesses/docs)
- original_fine
- final_fine
```

**Why this helps:**
- **THIS IS THE GOLD MINE** - most valuable request
- Build comprehensive database of what works
- Smart case matching gets exponentially better
- Calculate exact win rates by violation, location, evidence
- Show users what contest grounds succeed in their specific area

### 8. Hearing Officer Statistics
**Request to:** Chicago Department of Administrative Hearings

**Request text:**
```
For each administrative hearing officer, past 3 years:
1. Total cases heard
2. Dismissal rate by officer
3. Reduction rate by officer
4. Average fine reduction amount
5. Officer assignment by hearing location

Format: Officer ID/name, monthly statistics
```

**Why this helps:**
- Some officers are more lenient than others
- Users can see expected outcomes based on officer
- Identify patterns (some officers never dismiss camera tickets)

---

## 🎯 Enforcement Patterns

### 9. Officer Citation Statistics
**Request to:** Chicago Police Department

**Request text:**
```
For parking and moving violations (non-camera), past 3 years:
1. Citations issued per officer badge number
2. Citation rates by time of day and location
3. Contest rates by officer
4. Dismissal rates when officer doesn't appear at hearing
5. Officers with most contested tickets

Format: Officer badge, monthly citation counts, outcomes
```

**Why this helps:**
- Identify officers with abnormally high contest/dismissal rates
- Pattern of officer not appearing = likely dismissal
- Show if specific officer known for incorrect citations

### 10. Towing Company Contracts and Complaints
**Request to:** Chicago Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection

**Request text:**
```
For all towing companies authorized by Chicago:
1. Contract terms and service areas
2. Complaint logs by company
3. Impound fees charged
4. Response times
5. Violations and fines against companies

Format: Company name, complaint details, resolution
```

**Why this helps:**
- Users fighting towing fees can show company violations
- Pattern of complaints = defense for excessive fees
- Company contract violations = potential fee waiver

- Game-changing for smart matching
- Estimate 2-4 weeks to receive

**Camera Calibration:**
- Likely 200-300 cameras × 3 years = 600+ records
- May reveal 20-30% have had issues
- Estimate 2-3 weeks to receive

**Officer Statistics:**
- May be partially denied (privacy concerns)
- Aggregate stats likely available
- Estimate 3-4 weeks

## 💡 How This Data Improves the System

**Before FOIA data:**
- "Camera tickets are hard to contest" (generic)
- 10% win rate (general statistic)

**After FOIA data:**
- "Camera at Ashland & Belmont failed calibration 2 months before your ticket"
- "This intersection's yellow light is 2.8 seconds (below 3.0 second minimum)"
- "Based on 47 similar cases at this location with calibration issues, 65% were dismissed"
- "This camera generates 3× more revenue than average Chicago camera"

**Users get:**
- Specific defenses for their exact situation
- Ready-made evidence in their letter
- Higher confidence in contesting
- Better outcomes

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Tier 1 FOIAs** - Submit #1, #4, #7 immediately
2. **Set up data pipeline** - Create import scripts for CSV data
3. **Build database tables** - Add schemas above to Supabase
4. **Create search features** - Let users search calibration records by date/location
5. **Enhance letters** - Auto-include relevant FOIA findings in contest letters
6. **Dashboard** - Show "Problem Camera Locations" heatmap

This data would transform Ticketless Chicago from a tool that helps people contest to a tool that **gives them the actual evidence they need to win**.
