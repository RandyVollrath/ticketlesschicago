# Backup from ~/ticketlesschicago
Date: 2025-09-25

## Files Backed Up

### Unique Files (not in ticketless-chicago)
1. **add-service-access.sql** - SQL script for adding service access
2. **middleware.ts** - NextAuth middleware configuration
3. **signin.tsx** - Custom signin page
4. **dashboard.tsx** - Dashboard page
5. **nextauth-full.ts** - Full NextAuth configuration with service access logic

### Uncommitted Changes (saved as patches)
1. **nextauth-changes.patch** - Adds service_access tracking for multi-service support (ticketless + mystreetcleaning)
2. **stripe-webhook-changes.patch** - Updates to give TicketLess users access to both services

## Key Features in ticketlesschicago not in ticketless-chicago
- NextAuth authentication system (vs OAuth in ticketless-chicago)
- Service access control for multiple services
- Custom signin/dashboard pages

## Important Notes
- The ticketlesschicago repo has multi-service access logic that might be useful
- The service_access field allows users to have access to both ticketless and mystreetcleaning
- The uncommitted changes add this multi-service functionality

## GitHub Repository
- Remote: git@github.com:RandyVollrath/ticketlesschicago.git
- Has uncommitted changes that weren't pushed

## Decision
After backing up these files, the ~/ticketlesschicago folder can be safely deleted if:
1. You don't need the NextAuth authentication (ticketless-chicago uses OAuth)
2. The multi-service access feature is either not needed or already implemented differently
3. You've confirmed the GitHub repo ticketlesschicago isn't being used anywhere
